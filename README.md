# Catching_Cheater_Coin_Toss
Algorithm that tells you least amount of coin tosses to find over 80% of cheaters while only committing less than 5% false positives. 

Used for Science Venture Workshop. 
Note for those using this:
The game may not run if you don't have all the correct libraries installed. If not, use an online website that lets you adjust the probability of a coin flip. There are two files for the same thing in the Finding Cheater Algorithm file. The only difference is the one labeled OLD uses older print syntax while the one that isn't, uses the newer print syntax. The OLD one runs on the SV mac as the version of python it uses only accepts the older syntax. However, others with different versions may want to use the non OLD version.  It is also possible to run the Finding Cheater Algorithm on CodeSpaces using GitHub if you have an account. However, I have not found a way to run the game using CodeSpaces. I encourage someone to figure out how. Also, if you can make the game better/not look as bad that would be great as I am a beginner at PyGames.
